.TH NEMOVAR 1NEMO "7 March 2024"

.SH "NAME"
nemovar \- display NEMO variable(s)

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBnemovar\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBnemovar\fP reads and writes text based variables to a small database of persistent variables
that can cross different sessions, much like SHELL variables.
.PP
The current implementation uses a simple text file, but future implementation may also be able to
switch to shared memory, or whatever the environment provides.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so man1/parameters
.TP 20
\fBvar=\fP
Name of the variable. Default: not used.
.TP
\fBvalue=\fP
If used, the variable is getting a new value. Default: not used.
.TP
\fBshow=f|t\fP
If set, this will show all variables. If no var or value is given, the default is true, else false.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
In the current implementation, the NEMOVAR environment variable will be used. No shared memory yet.
For example on linux we might be able to use the shared memory as follows:
.nf

    export NEMOVAR=/dev/shm/nemovar.$USER
    nemovar a 10
    
.fi
to set the value of 10 to a. Then
.nf

    nemovar a
    
.fi
retrieves the value of a. And finally
.nf

    nemovar show=t
    
.fi
shows all variables

.SH "FORMAT"
Currently the format of the text file is a simple ASCII file, compatible with for example
\fIbash(1)\fP and \fIpython(1)\fP. All variables are explictly shown as strings:
.nf

    a="10"
    b="hello"
    c="3.141592"
    
.fi
data type interpretation is left to the client.

.SH "FUTURE"
1. A future implementation is planned, where a direct retrieval of NEMO variables is possible from the command line
(see \fIgetparam(3NEMO)\fP). For example:
.nf

     nemovar eps 0.05
     hackcode eps=%eps
     
.fi
Note that some table programs used %0, %1, %2, .... to refer to column numbers, so variable names cannot start with
a digit. Upper and Lower case should be allowed.
.PP
Recall that the current command line interface already can refer to other keywords, e.g.
.nf

    foobar a=1 b='$a'
    
.fi
would assign the same value to both a and b.

2. An option should exist to remove a variable from the database.

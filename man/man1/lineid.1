.TH LINEID 1NEMO "14 December 2024"

.SH "NAME"
lineid \- Identify peaks in a spectrum and optionally find lines

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBlineid\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlineid\fP identifies peaks in a spectrum, and
attempts to identify spectral lines. The units of the frequency
axis will need to be specified (the default is GHz) in order for the line identification to work.
.PP
Operation can occur in several modes.
.br
1. If the VLSR is given, a LineID is attempted. Either from a given
restfreq, or from a linelist.
.br
2. If the RESTFREQ is given, a VLSR is determined from the frequency of the
fitted peak.
.br
3. If neither is given, just the peak(s) are reported.
.PP
See also \fItablsqfit(1NEMO)\fP with the option \fBfit=peak\fP, and \fIccdmom(1NEMO)\fP has
an algorithm to find (properties of) the Nth peak using mom=3,30,31,32,33,34
.PP
More sophisticated algorithms can be find in for example ADMIT's LineID task.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following example smoothes a set of random values by 10 channels to create a handful
of peaks and investigates the strongest peak:
